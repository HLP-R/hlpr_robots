This package holds 2d and 3d navigation files for both simulation and actual execution, including maps and gazebo models.

Maps correspond to the floor that they represent. If a floor is not contiguous, then the map name specifies the cardinal direction that that map file describes.

3D simulated models of the gdc: 
gdc.sdf is fairly accurate model of the south 1st floor of the GDC.
gdc_multilevel.sdf is a fairly accurate model of the 1st floor, but with a portion of the 2nd floor atrium including the coffee shop area and elevator.
